 ## Technology ( Links ):

**1. [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/):**

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**2. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/):**

* Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

* Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

**3. [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize):**

* Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.

**4. [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2):**

* MySQL client for Node.js with focus on performance.

* MySQL2 is mostly API compatible with mysqljs and supports majority of features.

**5. [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv):**

* Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

* Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE.

**6. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia):**

* Insomnia is a free cross-platform desktop application that takes the pain out of interacting with and designing HTTP-based APIs. Insomnia combines an easy-to-use interface with advanced functionality like authentication helpers, code generation, and environment variables.
